Nothing comes to mind, so white's intention is probably to caste long or short - there's not much we can do here prophylactically.2 - Any forcing options on our side? Not so much, only capture B:f3 (except the absurd B:d4), but as we already know - it's a shame to get rid of a strong light-squared bishop here.3 - So we're looking for the worst-placed piece. The king has not castled yet, the queen and the rooks are in the starting positions.Qe7 is a healthy developing move, the queen's best place is e7 anyway (flexibility!), and you can delay castling, waitingt for white to show his direction.However, there was nothing wrong with the normal short castling 0-0 either - the h-file is supposed to be open, but it seems that white does not have enough resources to strengthen the attack. Especially Bg7 is a strong defender, with no opponent (dark-squares bishop) in white's camp."}

So probably support the knight with Rd8 first, then 0-0 - some gymnastics.2 - Do we have any direct options (checks, captures, threats)? Aside from trades on d7 (which has been already discussed), nothing special we can do.3 - So we're looking for the worst-placed piece- Rh1 doesn't do anything special so far, but at least it's on a half-open lane, so if black goes 0-0 in the future, it might be useful there,- Ra1 is out of the game,- Ke1 - castling not done yet.So the choice seems relatively simple - we finish the development with 0-0-0 and play on with the advantage of space and advantage in development - and the opponent has to spend time defending the Rd8 knight after which we can, for example, push f2-f4 to gain even more space in the center."}

Ive played the ECK a lot of time but I prefer the Advanced Caro Kann, Two Knights Caro Kann and of course the Classical way of playing the Caro Kann. To be honest Ive stopped playing the ECK with the white pieces since it gives black the opportunity to develop with ease. Black's position remains as flexible as it would ever be and by the way many people have been telling me that theECK is probably a very good opening against the Caro Kann and even a handful of people Including Bobby Fischer employed it and had a great success in playing it. But the problem is if Black knows what he is doing you are most likely toast since black gets the opportunity to counter attack the ECK with the Grunfeld set up. Nobody has every tried to play the Grunfeld against me, they prefer to go for the Horwitz set up WHICH is probably a horrible way of meeting the ECK with black.

First of all the LSB is stuck since the light squared pawns has fixated the position. Second Black gets a very few counterplay, the queenside is the only availableplace for black to target on. The Grunfeld is rather universal, black is aiming at the kingside and at the center aswell. Queenside counterplay is rather optional for the grunfeld line but it remains rather flexible."}

The ECK is probably the most easiest way to handle the Caro Kann, why? Well it lessens the theory and it consolidates white position aswell. There are two type of ECK players in here, one is people who plays the exchanged variation because they do not have the exact repertoire to meet the Caro Kann so they decided to stick to their e4 e5 principle. hey try to replicate the opening, to try and make it similar to e4 e5 even if its the Caro Kann. The other is the ones that wants to cut of loads of opening homework and theory and try to keep the position simpler compared to the other Caro variations and at the same time try to achieve an improvise London System against black with the Horwitz with the c pawn missing. Ive played the ECK a lot of time but I prefer the Advanced Caro Kann, Two Knights Caro Kann and of course the Classical way of playing the Caro Kann. To be honest Ive stopped playing the ECK with thewhite pieces since it gives black the opportunity to develop with ease. Black's position remains as flexible as it would ever be and by the way many people have been telling me that the ECK is probably a very good opening against the Caro Kann and even a handful of people Including Bobby Fischer employed it and had a great success in playing it. But the problem is if Black knows what he is doing you are most likely toast since black gets the opportunity to counter attack the ECK with the Grunfeld set up. Nobody has every tried to play the Grunfeld against me, they prefer to go for the Horwitz set up WHICH is probably a horrible way of meeting the ECK with black. In this opening line Im going to explain to you what white is trying to prove and achieve. I would tell you what black should do and even the slightest bit of sidelines in here are all covered.

Black gets a lot of counterplay on the queenside aswell. In the French Defence the LSB isoften a problem since it is a bad bishop. Black struggles to put out the LSB on the French Defence. Ive played the French Defence and I know the theory behind it. Sometimes in the French Defence black has to voluntarily double his b pawn just so he can get rid of the LSB in exchange for white's bishop or knight.

I recommend the principled and classical way to handle the Advanced Variation of the Caro Kann. Abbreviated as the ACK. Black gets to maximise his bishop on f5. Black gets a lot of counterplay on the queenside aswell. In the French Defence the LSB isoften a problem since it is a bad bishop. Black struggles to put out the LSB on the French Defence. Ive played the French Defence and I know the theory behind it. Sometimes in the French Defence black has to voluntarily double his b pawn just so he can get rid of the LSB in exchange for white's bishop or knight.
