Nothing comes to mind, so white's intention is probably to caste long or short - there's not much we can do here prophylactically.2 - Any forcing options on our side? Not so much, only capture B:f3 (except the absurd B:d4), but as we already know - it's a shame to get rid of a strong light-squared bishop here.3 - So we're looking for the worst-placed piece. The king has not castled yet, the queen and the rooks are in the starting positions.Qe7 is a healthy developing move, the queen's best place is e7 anyway (flexibility!), and you can delay castling, waitingt for white to show his direction.However, there was nothing wrong with the normal short castling 0-0 either - the h-file is supposed to be open, but it seems that white does not have enough resources to strengthen the attack. Especially Bg7 is a strong defender, with no opponent (dark-squares bishop) in white's camp."}

So probably support the knight with Rd8 first, then 0-0 - some gymnastics.2 - Do we have any direct options (checks, captures, threats)? Aside from trades on d7 (which has been already discussed), nothing special we can do.3 - So we're looking for the worst-placed piece- Rh1 doesn't do anything special so far, but at least it's on a half-open lane, so if black goes 0-0 in the future, it might be useful there,- Ra1 is out of the game,- Ke1 - castling not done yet.So the choice seems relatively simple - we finish the development with 0-0-0 and play on with the advantage of space and advantage in development - and the opponent has to spend time defending the Rd8 knight after which we can, for example, push f2-f4 to gain even more space in the center."}
